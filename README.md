## **Portfolio of a Data Professional**

I turn complex data into actionable insights. With experience in medical imaging, clinical research, and large-scale data pipelines, I design and implement systems that make data usable, reliable, and meaningful. I specialize in combining technical rigor—AI modeling, data cleaning, pipeline automation—with real-world problem solving, collaboration, and clear communication to ensure that insights drive impact.
