## **Human-Centered Healthcare Technology**

I design and evaluate healthcare technologies that are safe, intuitive, and aligned with real-world clinical workflows. My work bridges clinical research, medical imaging AI, and user-centered evaluation to improve how clinicians interact with complex systems. I focus on reducing cognitive load, improving reliability, and supporting decision-making through thoughtful design and analysis.

## **Core Competencies**

**Human-Centered Design & Workflow Optimization:** Observing and improving clinical processes, reducing cognitive load, and enhancing safety and efficiency.

**Healthcare AI & Medical Imaging:** Developing AI tools for image quality evaluation and segmentation that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows.

**Multidisciplinary Collaboration & Clinical Insight:** Bridging clinicians, researchers, and technical teams to translate real-world needs into actionable solutions.

### Project 1: Data Transfer Pipeline: From Manual Chaos to Scalable System

**Context**
In my job at Boston Children's Hospital we worked with MRI data day and night. This data was acquired on MRI Scanners accross the Hospitals and Shipped to PACS (the hospital system storing imaging data), it then had to find it's way to the research folders to be further processed and analyzed.

**Problem:**  
Before this project, data transfer was entirely manual and could only be done by highly technical staff who knew PACS, command-line tools, and internal programs. Each participant required about an hour of effort, creating bottlenecks and slowing research workflows.  

**Solution / What I Built:**  
I designed a CSV-based data transfer pipeline that allowed non-technical team members to pull the right data efficiently. Key steps included:  
- Defining essential fields (date, MRN, acquisition type) and ensuring reliability without adding unnecessary complexity, such as accession numbers that were not consistently available.  
- Collaborating with the IT team to align technical requirements with real-world workflow.  
- Training non-technical recruitment staff to operate the pipeline, turning a previously specialized task into an everyday process.  
- Establishing an ongoing feedback loop to collect usability issues and refine the system continuously.  

**Challenges:**  
- Adoption was the main hurdle: while technically the system worked, some users stopped using it because of unclear timelines, lack of support, and limited team coverage.  
- Identifying these organizational and workflow barriers required investigation and direct communication with users.  

**How I Made Decisions:**  
I treated user behavior as data. When someone stopped using the pipeline, I investigated why rather than assuming technical failure. I prioritized solutions that matched existing knowledge (MRNs, dates) and reduced dependence on specialized skills. Only after identifying systemic patterns did I escalate recommendations to leadership.  

**Impact:**  
- Reduced data transfer time from ~1 hour per participant to ~5 minutes.  
- Shifted responsibility from technical staff to everyday team members.  
- Recommendations for scaling and institutional adoption were supported by leadership.  
- Created a model for combining technical solutions with human-centered design, ensuring that pipelines are both efficient and actually used.
