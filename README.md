### Project 1: Data Transfer Pipeline: From Manual Chaos to Scalable System

**Problem:**  
Before this project, data transfer was entirely manual and could only be done by highly technical staff who knew PACS, command-line tools, and internal programs. Each participant required about an hour of effort, creating bottlenecks and slowing research workflows.  

**Solution / What I Built:**  
I designed a CSV-based data transfer pipeline that allowed non-technical team members to pull the right data efficiently. Key steps included:  
- Defining essential fields (date, MRN, acquisition type) and ensuring reliability without adding unnecessary complexity, such as accession numbers that were not consistently available.  
- Collaborating with the IT team to align technical requirements with real-world workflow.  
- Training non-technical recruitment staff to operate the pipeline, turning a previously specialized task into an everyday process.  
- Establishing an ongoing feedback loop to collect usability issues and refine the system continuously.  

**Challenges:**  
- Adoption was the main hurdle: while technically the system worked, some users stopped using it because of unclear timelines, lack of support, and limited team coverage.  
- Identifying these organizational and workflow barriers required investigation and direct communication with users.  

**How I Made Decisions:**  
I treated user behavior as data. When someone stopped using the pipeline, I investigated why rather than assuming technical failure. I prioritized solutions that matched existing knowledge (MRNs, dates) and reduced dependence on specialized skills. Only after identifying systemic patterns did I escalate recommendations to leadership.  

**Impact:**  
- Reduced data transfer time from ~1 hour per participant to ~5 minutes.  
- Shifted responsibility from technical staff to everyday team members.  
- Recommendations for scaling and institutional adoption were supported by leadership.  
- Created a model for combining technical solutions with human-centered design, ensuring that pipelines are both efficient and actually used.
