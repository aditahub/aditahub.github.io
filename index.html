  <!-- Intro Section -->
  <h2 class="section-title">Human Thinking, Practical Impact</h2>
  <p>I design and evaluate healthcare technologies that are safe, intuitive, and aligned with real-world clinical workflows. My work bridges clinical research, medical imaging AI, and user-centered evaluation to improve how clinicians interact with complex systems. I focus on reducing cognitive load, improving reliability, and supporting decision-making through thoughtful design and analysis.</p>

    <h3>Project 1: Data Transfer Pipeline: From Manual Chaos to Scalable System</h3>

    <p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
    In my job at Boston Children's Hospital we worked with MRI data day and night. This data was acquired on MRI scanners across the hospitals and shipped to PACS (the hospital system storing imaging data). It then had to find its way to the research folders to be further processed and analyzed.</p>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
    Before this project, data transfer was entirely manual and could only be done by highly technical staff who knew PACS, command-line tools, and internal programs. Each participant required about an hour of effort, creating bottlenecks and slowing research workflows.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution / What I Built:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a CSV-based data transfer pipeline allowing non-technical team members to pull the right data efficiently.</li>
      <li>Defined essential fields (date, MRN, acquisition type) and ensured reliability without adding unnecessary complexity.</li>
      <li>Collaborated with the IT team to align technical requirements with real-world workflow.</li>
      <li>Trained non-technical staff to operate the pipeline, turning a specialized task into an everyday process.</li>
      <li>Established a feedback loop to refine the system continuously based on user input.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>
    Adoption was the main hurdle: while technically the system worked, some users stopped using it due to unclear timelines, limited support, and team coverage. Identifying these organizational and workflow barriers required direct communication with users.</p>

    <p><strong>How I Made Decisions:</strong><br>
    I treated user behavior as data. When someone stopped using the pipeline, I investigated why rather than assuming technical failure. Solutions prioritized existing knowledge and reduced dependence on specialized skills. Systemic patterns were escalated to leadership for broader adoption.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced data transfer time from ~1 hour per participant to ~5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Shifted responsibility from technical staff to everyday team members.</li>
      <li>Leadership supported scaling and institutional adoption recommendations.</li>
      <li>Created a model for combining technical solutions with human-centered thinking, ensuring systems are both efficient and actually used.</li>
    </ul>
